      <h2>Problem / Data Domain</h2>
      <p>
        Music has a powerful link to human emotion, yet most music platforms focus only on recommendation algorithms, 
        not on how users <em>feel</em>. College students often turn to songs to regulate or express moods, 
        but there’s no simple, safe, and creative space to document and share those emotional connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Existing apps like Spotify or Moodify focus on large-scale playlists or AI-generated mixes, 
        but they rarely let users <strong>actively reflect</strong> on their emotions. 
        Our app seeks to fill this gap by enabling users to connect mood, music, and memory in one personal, interactive platform.

      <h2>App Description</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Music with Mood</strong> is an interactive emotional playlist app 
        that allows users to create mood-based song cards, organize playlists, and share them with others. 
        The goal is to help users reflect on emotions, discover music from the community, and build connections through shared feelings.
      </p>

      <h3>Target Users</h3>
      <p>
        Primary users are college students and young adults who use music to express or regulate emotions. 
        The app will also consider accessibility for multilingual users and inclusive design for emotional diversity.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Interactive Features</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>1. Create & Edit Mood Cards (Full)</strong>: 
          Users can input a song, choose a mood emoji, and write a short diary entry to generate editable “mood cards.” 
          Data is stored locally for persistence.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2. Mood Playlist Builder (Full)</strong>: 
          Users organize songs into mood-based playlists, reorder them via drag-and-drop, 
          and save a “Today’s Mood Playlist.”
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3. Public Mood Wall (Full)</strong>: 
          Users can toggle a song as “Public” to share it on a global mood wall. 
          Others can browse and discover songs by mood category.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>4. Share Designer (Half)</strong>: 
          Users can design a poster-style share card for a mood or playlist 
          and download it as a PNG image.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Data & Persistence</h3>
      <p>
        The app will use <code>localStorage</code> for data persistence. 
        All song cards, playlists, and public posts are stored and loaded from local storage, 
        simulating a personal “database.” 
        In future iterations, Firebase can be integrated for real-time multi-user sharing.
